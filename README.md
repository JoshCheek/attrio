# Attrio

Attributes for plain Ruby objects. The goal is to provide an ability to define attributes for your models without reinventing the wheel all over again. Attrio doesn't have any third-party dependencies like Virtus or ActiveAttr and does not redefine any methods inside your class, unless you want it to.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'attrio'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install attrio

## Note on Patches / Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
